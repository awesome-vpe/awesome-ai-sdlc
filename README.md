# Awesome AI-SDLC [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated, time-aware collection of resources documenting how GenAI is transforming the Software Development Life Cycle — from requirements to production, from individual tools to organizational change.

**Why this list?** The AI-SDLC landscape is evolving faster than any previous shift in software engineering. Resources from 6 months ago may already be outdated. This list captures not just *what* exists, but *when* it emerged and *what the evidence says*.

## How This List Is Organized

Most awesome lists organize by tool category. This one organizes by **SDLC phase** because the transformation is uneven — some phases are 10x disrupted while others remain stubbornly human. Each entry includes a date tag to track the rapid evolution.

**Date tags:** `[YYYY-MM]` — when the resource was published or last significantly updated.

**Evidence ratings:**
- 🟢 Empirical study (RCT, large-scale data, peer-reviewed)
- 🟡 Industry report (survey-based, vendor research)
- 🔵 Practitioner insight (blog, talk, experience report)
- 🟠 Theoretical / opinion (thought leadership, predictions)
